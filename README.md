# Parcel delivery system

## Description
Spring parcel system backend using JPA, Spock, Spring Web and Groovy. <p>
To provide a fully functional UI the project can be extended with Webpages using thymeleaf for example. However, because this was just a quick experiment for learning purposes, I used it with Postman.

## Project Goal
This Project was created for learning more about writing REST backends with Groovy combined with Spock as the testing framework. <p>
